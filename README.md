# State-of-Charge-Estimation
Developed simulations to estimate the State of Charge (SoC) of lithium batteries using advanced filtering techniques.
– Conducted experiments, parameter identification, and simulation using the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF).
– Tools & technologies used: Python, EKF, Data Acquisition Systems, and Battery Modeling Techniques,Jupyter Notebook.
– Acknowledged the support and contributions of team members in achieving project milestones.
